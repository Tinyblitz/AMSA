# AMSA

My Masters Project @ Georgia Tech - 2022-2023

AMSA, or After-Movie Social Accelerator, is a supplementary mobile prototype used to evaluate the potential of social sharing as a future prospect for improving the in-person experience at domestic cinemas.

The protoype itself is not the final solution but was made more-so as an evaluation tool.

The project requires node dependencies and uses socket.io.
Run using a local server and change the port ID in both the server.js and script.js files.

Known Error: logging into the app, exiting, and then relogging in will mess up the logical progression of the prototype.
On the host computer (where the server is hosted), press the "=" key to advance to the second stage of the scenario.
